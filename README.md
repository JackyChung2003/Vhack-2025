Welcome to **Dermanow**, a trust-focused blockchain donation platform created to restore transparency and accountability in charitable giving.

This platform was built using modern web technologies including **React**, **Vite**, and **Solidity**, with **Supabase** powering our backend and smart contracts deployed via **Thirdweb**.

---

## 🌟 Vision

To build a world where every donation is seen, felt, and remembered.

## 🚀 Mission

To rebuild trust in charitable giving through technology, transparency, and community engagement.

## 🔍 Project Overview

In Malaysia and beyond, donations often go untracked and charities struggle to prove their impact. **Dermanow** bridges this gap by enabling:

- Transparent donations via smart contracts.
- Flexible donation options (Success-Only or Always).
- Real-time visual updates for donors.
- Vendor-based procurement with verification.

## 🏗️ Backend Architecture

### Smart Contract (DonationTracker.sol)

The core of our blockchain integration is the `DonationTracker` smart contract which provides:

- **Transparent Donation Records**: All donations permanently recorded on the blockchain
- **Detailed Metadata Support**: JSON metadata for each donation
- **Event Emission**: Real-time events for donation tracking
- **Query Capabilities**: Methods to retrieve individual and latest donations

### Backend Services

Our backend ecosystem includes:

- **Node.js API Server**: Secure API endpoints for blockchain interactions
- **Donation Blockchain Service**: Handles on-chain donation recording and verification
- **Supabase Integration**: SQL-based persistence with blockchain reference fields

### API Endpoints

The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for:

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /donations` - Record a donation on the blockchain
- `GET /donations/:id` - Get details of a donation by ID
- `GET /donations` - Get latest donations

### Security Features

- API key authentication for all backend endpoints
- Secure private key management via environment variables
- Transparent transaction verification via Etherscan
- Admin-only contract interaction for data integrity
